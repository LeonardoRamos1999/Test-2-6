Hello, This will be used as my file for my first Git hub entry. This will be uploaded from my local storage to my git hub page and repository. For now we will note the steps taken to get this result. 

First step apart from install is establishing a connection to our git hub username and email 
GitHub Desktop is just a GUI that can make this easier same with gitCLI.

establish an id using a command like "git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
git config --global user.email "leoramos123456@gmail.com"

git init 	\\to create a local repo 
git add "Git hub doc.txt"	\\Stages	
git commit -m "latest version"		\\commits 
git remote add orgin https://github.com/LeonardoRamos1999/Test-2-6.git 		\\Makes our connection to the repo	

git remote -v  \\verifies URL
git log --oneline  \\shows committed w/ message
git push -u origin main  \\pushes our work to the connected url. This does prompt me to sign in and done.
